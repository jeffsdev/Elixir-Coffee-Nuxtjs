# Elixir Coffee - NuxtJS
#### Jeff Seymour
##### 2021

## Description
##### This is a simple brochure website that I designed and coded for a fake coffee shop, both as an example project for my developer portfolio and to explore building a static site using Vue and Nuxt.

### Technologies Used
Vue.js / Nuxt

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
